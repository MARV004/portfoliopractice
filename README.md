# portfoliopractice
This is a practice project which I started with the intention of eventually using it as a "curriculum" to show to 
recruiters during hiring processes.

I meant to practice CSS styling and animations while also informing recruiters of the technologies I can handle;
in this case HTML, CSS , JAVASCRIPT and soon REACT.
