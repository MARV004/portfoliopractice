// In this file we are going to write the problems. Let's keep all in english to practice that as well.

// 1. Create a function that returns me an array of 10 names with alphabetically order.

// 2. Given an array of numbers, I want the sum of all of those numbers:
    // Example: [10, 6, 8] be equal 24.

// 3. You have an array of person objects, where each object contains a name and age.
// Your task is to calculate the average age of all the people in the array and return the result.
    // Example: const people = [
//   { name: 'John', age: 25 },
//   { name: 'Jane', age: 30 },
//   { name: 'Sam', age: 20 },
//   { name: 'Alice', age: 35 },
//   { name: 'Bob', age: 27 }
// ];
